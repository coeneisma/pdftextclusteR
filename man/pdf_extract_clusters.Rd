\title{Extract the Text Per Cluster from the \code{\link[=pdf_detect_clusters]{pdf_detect_clusters()}} object}
\usage{
pdf_extract_clusters(pdf_data, combine = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pdf_data}{result of the \code{\link[=pdf_detect_clusters]{pdf_detect_clusters()}}-function or a page of
this result}

\item{combine}{logical; if TRUE (default) and input is a list of tibbles, the
function returns one combined tibble with a page number column added. If
FALSE, returns a list of tibbles.}
}
\value{
If the input is a list of tibbles and combine=TRUE (default), a
single tibble is returned containing the text of all clusters with an added
page number column. If the input is a list of tibbles and combine=FALSE, a
list-object is returned, where each element is a tibble containing the text
extracted from each cluster on a page. If the input is a single tibble, a
tibble is returned directly, containing the text extracted from each
cluster on that page, including a word count per cluster.

As an end user, you mainly want to work with the text from the different
detected text clusters. This function combines the text from each cluster
into a character string and places it in a Tibble. A word count is added
per cluster.
