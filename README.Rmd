The [pdftools](https://docs.ropensci.org/pdftools/) package is available for importing PDF files. However, this package does not work optimally when importing PDF files with multiple columns and text boxes. Since the`pdftools::pdf_text()` function from the `pdftools` package processes text line by line, it often fails to maintain the context of the text. As a result, the output may contain sentences with unrelated fragments of text from different parts of the page. Words that are not placed in the correct context are unsuitable for text analysis. 

However, the words grouped into clusters by this package using a Density-Based Spatial Clustering algorithm are likely to be contextually related and thus suitable for text analysis.

See `vignette("pdftextclusteR")` for more information on the usage of the package.
